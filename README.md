# Bioinformatics project

This repository contains the project for the [**Bioinformatics**](http://informatica.math.unipd.it/laureamagistrale/bioinformatica.html)
course at the [University of Padua](http://www.unipd.it/). 

This work is about the study of a genome of a _Lactobacillus casei_ that is _3,079,196bp_ long. The aim of the project is the “resequencing” of a similar bacterium that we call _lact.sp_, using **mate pairs reads**. In particular we want to see if _lact.sp_ has genomic structural variations. We suspect that the _lact.sp_ genome may have small and large deletions, insertions and inversions, and we want to find where they are.

The lecture was held in the first semester of the Academic Year 2017/2018 of the [Master Degree](http://informatica.math.unipd.it/laureamagistrale/index.html) in Computer Science.
