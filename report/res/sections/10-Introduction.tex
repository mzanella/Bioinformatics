\chapter{Introduction}
In this report you could find the discussion about the Bioinformatics project,
based on the study of a genome of a \lacto{} that is \textit{\lactolength{}bp}
long.

The aim of the project is the ``resequencing'' of a similar bacterium that we
call \texttt{lact.sp}, using mate pairs reads. In particular we want to see if
\texttt{lact.sp} has genomic structural variations. We suspect that the 
\texttt{lact.sp} genome may have small and large deletions, insertions and
inversions, and we want to find where they are.
